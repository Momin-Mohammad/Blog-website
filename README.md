# Deployed Site : 
[All News Site]  https://all-news-website.netlify.app

# User Authentication :
- User authentication is required when user is trying to add comment to a news. The email address needs to be valid otherwise a popup will occur for invalid email address. 

# Admin Authentication :
- The admin page can only be accessed by hitting the route "https://all-news-website.netlify.app/admin". The route is protected, as only admin can access it. The Admin needs to login first to access the Admin page.
- For Admin authentication a login page is given where the admin has to fill his/her email and password. There is no registeration page built in the frontend as for the Blog site there is generally only one Admin i.e the site owner. The Admin credentials are already stored in the backend by posting the credentials to the registeration route built in the backend.
